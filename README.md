# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of applied machine learning projects completed during academic coursework and independent research.  
Focuses on building end-to-end pipelines for prediction, evaluation, and decision-making using real-world datasets.

## Overview

These projects emphasize:

- data cleaning and feature engineering
- model training and validation
- out-of-sample testing
- interpretable results
- reproducible research workflows

The goal is not just fitting models, but building reliable systems that generalize.

## Methods & Tools

- Linear / Logistic Regression
- Lasso / Ridge Regularization
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
- Time Series Models
- Cross-validation & walk-forward testing

Tech stack:

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Visualization (matplotlib / seaborn)
- Jupyter / research notebooks

## Example Topics

- Housing price prediction
- Stock return forecasting
- Volatility modeling
- Factor-based signal construction
- Classification and clustering tasks

## Structure
