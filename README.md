## ⚙️ What’s inside

### 📈 Supervised Learning
• Logistic Regression  
• k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
• Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
• Gradient Descent (from-scratch optimization)  
• Iowa Housing Price Prediction (regression pipeline)  
→ prediction, classification, and model evaluation

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
• K-Means clustering  
• PCA dimensionality reduction  
• Stock variance decomposition & factor analysis  
→ structure discovery in high-dimensional data

### 🧠 Pattern Detection
• Convolution-based pattern extraction  
• time-series signal recognition  
• feature engineering for financial data  
→ identifying local structures in noisy markets

## 🧠 Philosophy

Simple models first  
Interpretability over complexity  
Out-of-sample validation always  

Models should explain data — not just fit it.
